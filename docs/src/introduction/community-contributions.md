# Community Contributions

As an open-source project, Zeebe welcomes extensions and contributions from the community.

We use [Awesome Zeebe](https://awesome.zeebe.io/) as a place to keep track of Zeebe ecosystem contributions, such as...

* Clients
* Workers
* Exporters
* Applications

...along with other integrations such as Spring-Zeebe and the Apache Kafka connector.

If you built something for the Zeebe ecosystem, we encourage you to [add it to Awesome Zeebe via pull request](https://github.com/zeebe-io/awesome-zeebe/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

If you're interested in contributing to the main Zeebe repository (vs. creating an extension that lives in its own repository), be sure to start with the ["Contributing to Zeebe" guide in GitHub](https://github.com/zeebe-io/zeebe/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)

If you have questions about contributing, [please let us know](/introduction/get-help-get-involved.html).
