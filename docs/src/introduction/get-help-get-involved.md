# Get Help and Get Involved

We provide a few different public-facing Zeebe support and feedback channels so that users can ask questions, report problems, and make contributions.

### Zeebe User Forum

The best place to ask questions about Zeebe and to troubleshoot issues is the Zeebe user forum.

The Zeebe team monitors the forum closely, and we do our best to respond to all questions in a timely manner.

### Public Slack Group

There's a public Zeebe Slack group where you can ask one-off questions, share community contributions, and connect with other Zeebe users.
