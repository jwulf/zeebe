# Deploy a Workflow to Zeebe

_In this section, we're going to start up the Zeebe broker as well as Camunda Operate, a tool that gives you visibility into deployed workflows and running workflow instances and contains tooling for fixing problems in those workflow instances._

_We offer Operate free of charge for unrestricted **non-production** use because we think it's a great tool for getting familiar with Zeebe and building initial proofs-of-concept. And at this time, Operate is available for non-production use only. In the future, we'll offer an Operate enterprise license that allows for production use, too._

Before we run the Zeebe broker, we need to configure an Elasticsearch exporter in the Zeebe configuration file. Which leads to the question: what's an exporter, and why is Elasticsearch a part of this tutorial?

The answer is that Zeebe itself doesn't store historic data related to your workflow instances. If you want to keep this data for auditing or for analysis, you need to export to another storage system. Zeebe _does_ provide an easy-to-use exporter interface, and it also offers an Elasticsearch exporter out of the box. (_[See: Exporters](https://docs.zeebe.io/basics/exporters.html)_)

Elasticsearch is also what Camunda Operate uses to store data, so to run Operate, you need to enable the Elasticsearch exporter in Zeebe and run an instance of Elasticsearch. In this section and the next section of the tutorial, we'll use Operate to visualize what's going on in Zeebe with each step we take.

First, open the `zeebe.cfg.toml` file (in the `conf` directory of the Zeebe broker) and enable the Zeebe Elasticsearch exporter.

Note that you need to un-comment _only_ these three lines to enable the exporter:

> **Note:** Some command examples might not work on Windows if you use cmd or
> Powershell. For Windows users we recommend to use a bash-like shell, i.e. Git
> Bash, Cygwin or MinGW for this guide.

Next, open Terminal or another command line tool and start up Elasticsearch.


```
cd elasticsearch-6.7.0
```


**Linux / Mac**


```
bin/elasticsearch
```


**Windows**


```
bin\elasticsearch.bat
```


You'll know that startup was successful when you see something like:


```
[2019-04-05T10:26:22,288][INFO ][o.e.n.Node ] [oy0juRR] started
```


Then start the Zeebe broker in another Terminal window.


```
cd zeebe-broker-0.17.0
./bin/broker
```


You can use the Zeebe CLI to check the status of your broker. Open a new Terminal window and change into the Zeebe broker directory, then run the following:

**Linux**


```
./bin/zbctl status
```


**Mac**


```
./bin/zbctl.darwin status
```


**Windows**


```
./bin/zbctl.exe status
```


You should see a response like this one:


```
Cluster size: 1
Partitions count: 1
Replication factor: 1
Brokers:
  Broker 0 - 0.0.0.0:26501
    Partition 0 : Leader
```


And finally, start Operate in yet another Terminal window. Note that you'll need port 8080 in order to run Operate and access the UI, so be sure to check that it's available.


```
cd camunda-operate-distro-1.0.0-RC2
bin/operate
```


To confirm that Operate was started, go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080). You should see the following:

You can leave this tab open as we'll be returning to it shortly.

For all Zeebe-related operations moving forward, we'll be using Zeebe's command-line interface (CLI). In a real-world deployment, you likely wouldn't rely on the CLI to send messages or create job workers. Rather, you would embed Zeebe clients in worker microservices that connect to the Zeebe engine.

But for the sake of keeping this guide simple (and language agnostic), we're going to use the CLI.  

Next, we'll deploy our workflow model via the CLI. Open a new terminal window and change into the Zeebe broker directory.

First, let's check the status of our broker.

**Linux**


```
./bin/zbctl status
```


**Mac**


```
./bin/zbctl.darwin status
```


**Windows**


```
./bin/zbctl.exe status
```


You should see a response like this one:


```
Cluster size: 1
Partitions count: 1
Replication factor: 1
Brokers:
  Broker 0 - 0.0.0.0:26501
    Partition 0 : Leader
```


OK, we just double-checked that our broker is running as expected. Next, we'll deploy the workflow model we created in the previous section.

**Linux**


```
./bin/zbctl deploy order-process.bpmn
```


**Mac**


```
./bin/zbctl.darwin deploy order-process.bpmn
```


**Windows**


```
./bin/zbctl.exe deploy order-process.bpmn
```


You should see a response like this one:


```
{
  "key": 2,
  "workflows": [
    {
      "bpmnProcessId": "order-process",
      "version": 1,
      "workflowKey": 1,
      "resourceName": "order-process.bpmn"
    }
  ]
}
```


Now we'll take a look at the Operate user interface:



*   Go to [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and use the credentials `demo` / `demo` to access Operate
*   Click on the "Running Instances" option in the navigation bar at the top of the interface
*   Select the order-process workflow from the "Workflows" selector on the left side of the screen

You should see the workflow model we just deployed â€“ the same model we built in the previous section. You won't see any workflow instances because we haven't created them yet, and that's exactly what we'll do in the next section.
